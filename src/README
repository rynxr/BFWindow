Due to the quata limitation of Github, I have to put the source tarballs in the GoogleDrive. 

Please contact ary.xsnow@gmail.com for all tarballs mentioned in BFWindow/README.md.

RIPE contains the security validation results based on RIPE testbed.

mibench contains the performance evaluation results based on mibench benchmark.
